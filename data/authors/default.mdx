## Hello, Y'all!  I'm Seonghwa Lee (aka MartianLee)

As a professional, my goal is to excel as a congenial and effective team member. I am dedicated to the development of growing products and believe in addressing issues through the **power of teamwork**

I had a passion for **JavaScript/Typescript** and web development. But I know all technologies are just tools. I'm not a fan of any specific technology. I'm a fan of **solving problems**.


## Tech stack

This blog is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using **Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog**.

I've been worked with various technologies. I started to work with Rails, after that I exprienced Django short time. After that I settled down with Javascript. I used Angular, React Native, React and Next.js in Production. 

Last job I was fullstack Developer with Node.js. I managed infra also html code for customers.
