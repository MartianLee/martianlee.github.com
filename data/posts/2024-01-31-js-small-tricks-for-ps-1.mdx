## Iteration in Array, Set, Map
Iterating through an array with an index is pretty straightforward. You can use the ES6 `forEach()` method:

```tsx
arr.forEach((item, index) => { ... });
```
However, when you want to return a value immediately while iterating through an object, it's not easy to exit the parent function.

In such cases, if we are willing to sacrifice a bit of time and space complexity, we can try `Object.entries()`. After that, we simply use `for...of` to iterate.

```tsx
for (let [index, value] of iterable) {
  console.log(index, value);
}
```
We also use `Map` and `Set` in problem-solving to decrease time complexity.

Therefore, we need to be proficient with for...in and `for...of` for iterating over objects.

## In Practice

For example, when you want to find numbers in an array without duplication and then iterate over the array, you can put all numbers into a `Set` and iterate over it using `for...of`. That’s it!
