## Problem

201.Bitwise AND of Numbers Range (leetcode daliy streak)

## Description

Input gives to number left, right. We need to caculate bitwise `&` calculation of all number in the range left to right.

```txt
Input: left = 5, right = 7
Output: 4
```

in this case, let's check all numbers with binary.
5 : 101
6 : 110
7 : 111

So, only bit 100, which is 4 can be 1.
result is 4

## Approach

### First

I write all number in binary. 1 to 15, and try to find pattern.

for example
```
3 is 011
7 is 111
```
and while 3 go to 7 it has number like 4 100, every bit will be 0 if you bitwise it all.

After that I found that, if two number share start bit (which means it is in the range of pow of 2), It is result.
But If they have difference length in binary like 3 and 7,

I take point with difference. and I try to calculate difference. 
```javascript
    const diff = (right - left);
    let binary = left.toString(2).split('');
    let pow = 1, count = 0;
    while (diff >= pow) {
        pow *= 2;
        count++;
    }
    binary = binary.slice(0, binary.length - count);
    binary = binary.concat(new Array(count).fill('0'));
    const result = parseInt(binary.join(""), 2);
```

But while I'm doing it I found that problem is not just difference.

for example, `11 to 12` is different with `13 to 14`.
It has same difference but result is different.

```
1011
1100
// result: 1000(2) = 8

1101
1110
// result : 1100(2) = 10
```

### Second

I found that problem is difference with close minimum pow of 2.
Also I just found that bit checking is recursive.

So case 13, 14
```
1101
1110
// check it has same bit? 1000 ✅
 101
 110
// check it has same bit? 100 ✅
  01
  10
// cend with 0
```

So the result is sum of 1000(2), and 100(2), `1100(2) = 10`


## Solution
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} left
 * @param {number} right
 * @return {number}
 */
var rangeBitwiseAnd = function (left, right) {
    if (left == right) {
        return left;
    }
    const closeLeft = 1 << 32 - Math.clz32(left);
    const closeRight = 1 << 32 - Math.clz32(right);
    const lowLeft = 1 << 31 - Math.clz32(left)
    if (closeLeft != closeRight) {
        return 0;
    }
    return lowLeft + rangeBitwiseAnd(left - lowLeft, right - lowLeft);
};
```


## Retrospect

I found that I'm still not get used to bit problems cause I take over 20 min to find the regularity.
Also I need to search the bitwise operator like `Math.clz32()` , It takes more time.
