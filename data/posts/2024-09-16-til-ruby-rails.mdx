## What I Learned

Couple of months of Rails experience, I summarazie something that I learned from ruby, rails's useful things.

### Safe Navigation Operator.

Introduced in Ruby 2.3.0, (Avoiding an undefined method for nil:NilClass error), similar to the try method in Rails.

So you can write
```ruby
user&.address&.zip
```
instead of
```ruby
if user
  user.address.zip
else
  nil
end
```

#### Alternatives
When only the first item in a chain is nullable, we can use && instead of &. to more accurately express our intention.
```ruby
user && user.address.zip
```
Beyond just using different syntax, there is also an opportunity to refactor. The chain of non-nullable methods can safely be extracted out. This likely results in cleaner code and also satisfies the law of demeter.
```
class User
  def zip
    address.zip
  end
end
```

### Dynamically define method

Defines an instance method in the receiver. The method parameter can be a Proc, a Method or an UnboundMethod object. If a block is specified, it is used as the method body.

from [apidock](https://apidock.com/ruby/Module/define_method)

```ruby
class Product
  class << self
    [:name, :brand].each do |attribute|
      define_method :"find_by_#{attribute}" do |value|
        all.find {|prod| prod.public_send(attribute) == value }
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### Ruby freeze

`freeze()`

Prevents further modifications to obj. A RuntimeError will be raised if modification is attempted. There is no way to unfreeze a frozen object. See also Object#frozen?.

from [apidock](https://apidock.com/ruby/Object/freeze)

```ruby
str = "this is string"
str.freeze

str.replace("this is new string") #=> FrozenError (can't modify frozen String)
or
str[0] #=> 't'
str[0] = 'X' #=> FrozenError (can't modify frozen String)
```

## Retrospect

Actually JS have similary like Ruby Safe Navigation. But define method is super nice for specific case. Like factory pattern. and easy-to-use pattern.
Also Freeze can be found in many language. But What I learned is to handle literals in class. In JS, I think I used enums. but It was not that smooth sometimes.
These are small part of ruby and I'm still getting used to them. I hope I can write ruby & rails fluently while following the community's rules.

Well Done !
